# PySpark-AWS
    Comprehensive Course Description:

    The hottest buzzwords in the Big Data analytics industry are Python and Apache Spark. PySpark supports the collaboration of Python and Apache Spark. In this course, you’ll start right from the basics and proceed to the advanced levels of data analysis. From cleaning data to building features and implementing machine learning (ML) models, you’ll learn how to execute end-to-end workflows using PySpark.

    Right through the course, you’ll be using PySpark for performing data analysis. You’ll explore Spark RDDs, Dataframes, and a bit of Spark SQL queries. Also, you’ll explore the transformations and actions that can be performed on the data using Spark RDDs and dataframes. You’ll also explore the ecosystem of Spark and Hadoop and their underlying architecture. You’ll use the Databricks environment for running the Spark scripts and explore it as well.

    Finally, you’ll have a taste of Spark with AWS cloud. You’ll see how we can leverage AWS storages, databases, computations, and how Spark can communicate with different AWS services and get its required data.

    Why Should You Learn PySpark and AWS?

    PySpark is the Python library that makes the magic happen.

    PySpark is worth learning because of the huge demand for Spark professionals and the high salaries they command. The usage of PySpark in Big Data processing is increasing at a rapid pace compared to other Big Data tools.

    AWS, launched in 2006, is the fastest-growing public cloud. The right time to cash in on cloud computing skills—AWS skills, to be precise—is now.
